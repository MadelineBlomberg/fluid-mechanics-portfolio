# Week 0 – Introduction and Setup

This week served as an initial preparation and setup phase for my Fluid Mechanics Learning Portfolio.

Note
Week 0 was completed over a single weekend and focused mainly on establishing 
the project structure and reviewing foundational mathematical and physical concepts.
As such, this week contains notes, formulas, and reflections — no code examples yet.

Goals
- Establish project folder structure and workflow.
- Define learning and documentation style for the portfolio.
- Review key mathematical tools: tensors, derivatives, conservation laws.
- Begin building personal understanding of core fluid mechanics concepts.

Reflections
This preparation week is intended to give me a solid starting point for the weeks ahead.
The goal of this entire project is to self-teach an undergraduate-level understanding of 
fluid mechanics and turbulence, while building a GitHub portfolio that demonstrates both 
technical understanding and the ability to combine modern computing with classical fluid dynamics.

More details about the overall project purpose are provided in the main repository README.
